Laundry Pickup Scheduler

This is a small project that helps users view laundry slots and book one for pickup. It is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also used JSON Server for saving the slots and bookings for my reliable customers

what my project does 
1  Shows a list of available laundry time slots
2  Lets users book a slot
3  Allows cancelling a booking
4  Has a search box to help find slots quickly

Files and folders used 

 index.html – main HTML file
 styles.css – styling for the app
 script.js – all JavaScript logic
 db.json – mock database file for JSON Server
